What if you could update all the DLSS/XeSS/FSR DLLs for the games detected on your system?
## Features

- Supports updating games from the following launchers:
  - Steam
  - Ubisoft
  - EA Play
  - Xbox Game Pass (PC)
  - Epic Games Launcher
  - GOG Galaxy
  - Battle.net (Note for Battle.net: Please ensure that the launcher is **open** before updating this launcher (this does not apply if you are entering a custom folder))
- A soft backup system for allowing restoration with [DLSS Swapper](https://github.com/beeradmoore/dlss-swapper).
- Support for updating Ray Reconstruction/Frame Generation/Streamline (Reflex Low Latency etc) DLL's.
- Support for updating XeSS/FSR/DirectStorage DLL's.
- A GUI!
- Support for manual folder locations.


The current supported DLL included is DLSS 4 (version 3.10.4).
The current supported DLL included is FSR 4 (version 4.0.2.0).
The current supported XESS DLL included is 2.0.1, please see the limitations [here](https://github.com/intel/xess/releases/tag/v2.0.1) for game support.

## Blacklisted Games

The list of games that are not supported (blacklisted) is now maintained in a separate repository as a CSV file. This allows for easier updates and potential future expansion of game-specific information without requiring changes to the main application. You can view the current list of blacklisted games here:

[DLSS-Updater-Blacklist](https://github.com/Recol/DLSS-Updater-Whitelist/blob/main/whitelist.csv)

The blacklist includes games that:
- Use their own version of DLSS for testing (e.g., 3DMark)
- Replace the DLL when the game is booted (e.g., Warframe)
- Are using a DLSS version <2.0 (these are non-updatable)
- Have specific compatibility issues with updated DLSS versions

The games that are blacklisted can be disabled manually by clicking the "Manage Blacklist" button in the GUI. This will allow you to skip games for whatever reason.

## Restoring modified DLL's
- In order to do this, simply rename the **.dlsss** file of the respective DLL which you wish to restore to **.dll** and overwrite the original file. 
- Support does not exist yet for being able to restore them using the program.

## Execution Instructions

### Running the Pre-built Application

1. Download the latest release from the [Releases](https://github.com/Recol/DLSS-Updater/releases) page.
2. Extract the downloaded folder.
3. Navigate to the `dist/DLSS_Updater` directory.
4. Run the `DLSS_Updater.exe` executable as an administrator.
5. The program will now boot.

## Winget

- Python 3.12 or higher
- Git
- pip (Python package installer)

#### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository:**

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Recol/DLSS-Updater.git
    cd DLSS-Updater
    ```

2. **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment:**

    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**

    cd dist/DLSS_Updater
    ```

    Run the `DLSS_Updater.exe` executable:

    ```sh
    .\DLSS_Updater.exe
    ```

## Easy Anti Cheat
- The tool will not globally block games as some games do allow for this, with that being said i will whitelist games as they appear if they do not function for this.

## Future Features

- Ability to restore and ~~create backups of DLL swaps~~. - This is currently being worked on, however support has been added for restoring with DLSS Swapper currently.
- Support for a [database](https://github.com/Recol/DLSS-Updater/issues/9).
- Insert xyz feature that wants to be requested.
- Automation support with external software.

## Release Notes

Each release includes detailed notes about new features, bug fixes, and other changes. You can find the release notes in the `release_notes.txt` file included with the application or in the Releases section.
