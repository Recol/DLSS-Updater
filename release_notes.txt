Version 3.9.3:
Bug Fixes - Games Tab Progressive Loading:
  - Fixed remaining game cards (beyond the initial 16) loading indefinitely as blank/grey boxes.
    Background batch cards now trigger Steam image fetching the same way the initial batch does.
  - Fixed a single exception in any background batch silently aborting all remaining card creation.
    Each batch is now independently protected so a failure in one batch doesn't prevent the rest.
Adjustments to default Linux permissions from :ro to :rw to enable writing to folders by default.
Dependency upgrades to fix library CVE reports.

Version 3.9.2:
Bug Fixes - Data Lifecycle and Version Handling:
  Critical Fixes:
  - Fixed phantom games persisting after uninstall. Games that are uninstalled now get cleaned up
    during the next scan. The scanner now runs post-scan cleanup to remove games whose paths
    no longer exist on the filesystem.
  - Fixed orphan DLL records accumulating when DLLs are removed from game directories.
    The cleanup process now removes DLL records for files that no longer exist.
  - Fixed version display inconsistency showing comma-separated versions (310,4,0,0) instead of
    dot-separated (310.4.0.0). All DLL versions are now normalized to dot format at extraction time.
  - Fixed MergedGame AttributeError crash when clicking Update/Restore in DLL group dialog
    for games with duplicate installations. Callbacks now always receive Game objects.
  - Fixed "Up to date" dialog showing stale versions. The DLL dialog now refreshes versions
    from the actual filesystem before displaying, ensuring accuracy.
  - Added cleanup_duplicate_games() and cleanup_duplicate_backups() calls during post-scan
    to prevent database bloat from duplicate entries.
  UI Improvements:
  - New shutdown progress dialog shows step-by-step progress when closing the application.
    Displays current operation (9 steps total) with progress bar and spinner.
    Prevents the appearance of the app "freezing" during cleanup.
Database:
  - Added cleanup_missing_games() - removes games whose paths no longer exist.
  - Added cleanup_orphan_dlls() - removes DLL records for deleted files.
  - Added perform_post_scan_cleanup() - unified post-scan cleanup orchestration.
  - Added refresh_dll_versions_for_game() - re-reads DLL versions from filesystem.

Version 3.9.1:
Linux DLSS SR Presets (Linux Only):
  - Reintroduced DLSS Super Resolution preset configuration for Linux users.
  - New "Linux DLSS SR Presets" tile in Settings (visible only on Linux with NVIDIA GPU).
  - Configure SR presets (Default/K/L/M) for Proton/Wine games via DXVK-NVAPI environment variables.
  - Preset K: Lighter preset, recommended for RTX 20/30 series GPUs.
  - Preset L: Balanced preset for quality/performance trade-off.
  - Preset M: Heavier preset, recommended for RTX 40/50 series GPUs.
  - Additional toggles: DLSS Debug Overlay, Wayland support, HDR support.
  - Live command preview shows generated Steam launch options.
  - Copy to clipboard button for easy pasting into Steam's "Set Launch Options".
  - Settings are persisted and remembered between sessions.
Bug Fixes:
  - Fixed "Copy Path" button crashing the application when clipboard is unavailable.
    All clipboard operations now wrapped in try-except with user-friendly error messages.
    Affected components: GameCard, LauncherCard, BackupCard, DLSSOverlayDialog, MainView.
  - Fixed "Refresh Games" throwing ImportError: cannot import name 'fetch_and_cache_steam_image'.
    The function was renamed to 'fetch_steam_image' but games_view.py still referenced the old name.
  - Fixed theme toggle on Windows throwing "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'msgspec._core'".
    PyInstaller's collect_all() doesn't recognize free-threaded Python extensions (.cp314t-*.pyd).
    Added custom PyInstaller hook (hook-msgspec.py) to manually detect and bundle the C extension.
  - Theme toggle now shows a restart dialog instead of attempting automatic restart.
    Automatic restart had compatibility issues with PyInstaller's frozen executables on both
    Windows and Linux. Users can choose "Restart Now" to exit or "Later" to continue working.

Version 3.9.0:
Navigation Transition Performance Optimization:
  - Reduced navigation transitions from ~600ms to <100ms (most views) / <200ms (games view).
  - Content detachment: Only the active view's subtree is attached to the Flet control tree.
    Inactive containers have content=None, removing their subtrees from serialization.
  - Single page.update() per transition instead of 2 (no fade-out gap needed).
  - GamesView isolation: Uses is_isolated=True so page.update() from navigation skips
    the ~500+ control games subtree. All GamesView internal updates use self.update().
  - ImageLoadCoordinator updated to use targeted view updates instead of page-level updates.
  - Game card fallback image loading uses card-level self.update() (~21 controls vs ~4000).
  Performance:
  - Hub/Settings transitions: ~50-70ms (was ~600ms) — ~10x faster.
  - Launchers transitions: ~120-160ms (was ~600ms) — ~4x faster.
  - Games transitions: ~50-80ms (was ~600ms) — ~10x faster (with isolation).
  - Games→Hub/Settings: ~30-40ms (was ~600ms) — ~18x faster.
  - Python view objects persist through detach/reattach (state preserved).

Version 3.8.0:
Hub-Based Navigation Redesign:
  - Replaced tab-based navigation with a staggered/asymmetric hub home screen.
  - Hub features 3 navigation cards: Launchers, Games, and Settings with left-edge accent bars.
  - Cards have hover animations (scale + shadow + border glow) using GPU-accelerated transforms.
  - Hub stats loaded via HyperParallelLoader showing game count and configured launcher count.
  - Added floating pill navigation bar (capsule at bottom) shown when inside views.
  - Pill features Home button + 3 view icons with active state (colored circle behind icon).
  - Fade transitions between views (150ms opacity, GPU-accelerated, no layout recalc).
  - Stack-based visibility toggle preserves view state across navigation (instant revisits).
  - Navigation stack supports back navigation via Escape key or pill Home button.
  - New Settings view provides access to Update Preferences, UI Preferences, Blacklist, Theme toggle.
  - Removed standalone Backups tab (backup/restore already available per-game in Games view).
  - All new components support ThemeAwareMixin for dark/light theme switching.
  Performance:
  - Hub screen: ~20 controls (3 cards x ~5 inner controls + layout wrappers).
  - Floating pill: ~13 controls total.
  - Fade transitions: 2x page.update() per transition (~300ms total).
  - Removing Backups tab eliminates ~400-1000 controls from the tree.

Version 3.7.0:
Free-Threaded Python GIL Fix - Resolved GIL re-enablement warning for msgpack:
  - Added PyInstaller OPTION 'X gil=0' to force GIL disabled at bootloader level.
  - Pinned msgpack>=1.1.2 (has Py_mod_gil declaration for free-threading compatibility).
  - Added RuntimeWarning filter for GIL-related warnings as defense-in-depth.
  - Windows and Linux builds now properly run with GIL disabled throughout.
Flet 0.80.4 Migration - Major framework upgrade with breaking API changes:
  Removed Features:
  - Removed DLSS SR Preset Override feature entirely.
    This feature allowed configuring DLSS Super Resolution presets (K/L/M) via Windows registry
    or Linux environment variables. The feature has been deprecated as NVIDIA's driver now
    handles preset selection automatically based on GPU architecture.
  Linux Build Fix:
  - Fixed GTK/SVG errors on Nobara 43 (Issue #127) caused by bundled system libraries.
  - PyInstaller now excludes libstdc++, libgcc_s, libc.so to use Flatpak runtime libraries.
  - This prevents CXXABI version conflicts with the Flatpak Freedesktop runtime.
  Framework Upgrade:
  - Upgraded from Flet 0.28.3 to Flet 0.80.4 (major version jump).
  - Modernized entry point from ft.app() to ft.run().
  - Updated all alignment constants to uppercase (ft.Alignment.CENTER, etc.).
  - Migrated dialog operations to new API (show_dialog/pop_dialog).
  - Updated FilePicker to use async service pattern (returns path directly).
  - Fixed ExpansionTile parameter (initially_expanded -> expanded).
  - Fixed PopupMenuItem parameter (text -> content).
  - Fixed Dropdown parameter (on_change -> on_select).
  - Fixed BlurStyle API (ShadowBlurStyle -> BlurStyle).
  API Compatibility:
  - Updated all UI components to use _page_ref for stored page reference.
  - In Flet 0.80.4+, controls inherit read-only 'page' property.
  - Updated session/client_storage usage for API compatibility.
  Performance Optimization:
  - Fixed sequential image loading (~1.9s) now batched for concurrent loading (~350-400ms).
  - ImageLoadCoordinator batches page.update() calls (2 calls instead of 11 per tab).
  - 50ms debounce window collects concurrent image loads for synchronized fade-in.
  - Upgraded skeleton loaders to ft.Shimmer for GPU-accelerated animation.
  - Documented Flet 0.80.4 performance patterns in CLAUDE.md for future reference.
  - Replaced "More Options" menu (585ms expand, 1183ms collapse) with 3 popup buttons (~20-30ms each).
  - New app bar layout: Community (pink heart), Preferences (orange gear), Application (blue grid).
  - Native Flutter PopupMenuButton provides GPU-accelerated menu rendering.
  - Eliminated 100+ nested controls in favor of lightweight popup menus.
  - Logger panel: Replaced height animation with visible+opacity pattern (~50-100ms faster toggle).
  - Games tab: Skip redundant rebuilds on tab switching when games already loaded (~1.5s saved).
  - Games tab: Respects "Keep Games in Memory" preference for instant tab switching.
  - Games tab: Progressive loading - first 16 cards shown instantly, rest load in background.
  - Games tab: Performance logging for data loading and card creation timings.
  - Backups tab: Switched from ResponsiveRow to virtualized GridView (only renders visible cards).
  - Backups tab: Progressive loading - first 12 cards shown instantly, rest load in background.
  - Backups tab: Parallel database queries with asyncio.gather() (~50% faster data loading).
  - Backups tab: Skip redundant rebuilds on tab switching (instant return visits).
  - Both tabs now scale to 200+ items with instant perceived loading.
  - Tab switching: Removed 200ms artificial delay, instant visual switch now.
  - Tab switching: Content visibility toggles immediately, shows loading indicator.
  - Tab switching: Data loading runs non-blocking via asyncio.create_task.
  - Tab switching: Cleanup runs non-blocking (asyncio.create_task).
  - Tab switching: User sees instant response, data loads transparently in background.
  Bug Fixes:
  - Fixed Restore button disappearing when Games tab is resized to narrow width.
    Root cause: Fixed 180px card height with clip behavior clipped wrapped buttons.
    Fix: Increased card height to 220px and adjusted GridView aspect ratio (1.78 -> 1.45).
  - Fixed search index being cleared on tab switch despite "Keep Games in Memory" preference.
    Root cause: Duplicate clear_index() call in _cleanup_games_view() ignored user preference.
    Fix: Removed redundant clear, now respects config_manager.get_keep_games_in_memory().
  - Fixed database connection pool closing on every tab switch to Launchers.
    Root cause: db_manager.close() was called when navigating to Launchers tab.
    Fix: Pool now stays open for app lifetime, only closes on shutdown (~200-500ms saved per switch).
Dependencies:
  - Flet 0.28.3 -> 0.80.4
  - flet-desktop 0.28.3 -> 0.80.4
  - flet-desktop-light 0.28.3 -> 0.80.4 (Linux)

Version 3.6.1:
GUI Unresponsiveness Fix - Critical fix for frozen/unclickable UI after launch:
  Critical Fixes:
  - Fixed LoadingOverlay blocking all mouse/keyboard input after hiding.
    Root cause: The overlay set a custom `self.visible = False` attribute that
    shadowed Flet's built-in visibility property. The Container remained rendered
    and intercepted all input events while appearing invisible to users.
    Fix: LoadingOverlay now dynamically adds/removes itself from page.overlay
    in show()/hide() methods, ensuring proper event handling.
  - Removed darkdetect dependency that caused blocking calls during startup.
    The darkdetect.theme() call could hang for 2-10 seconds on:
    - Linux Flatpak (D-Bus sandbox restrictions)
    - Wayland sessions (portal access issues)
    - Windows with certain antivirus software (registry query delays)
    Theme is now loaded from saved user preference or defaults to dark mode.
  - Fixed admin elevation race condition on Windows causing dual process instances.
    ShellExecuteW is asynchronous - the original process would exit before the
    elevated process fully started. Now uses ShellExecuteExW with proper process
    handle waiting (2 second timeout) before exit.
  Symptoms fixed:
  - GUI opens but nothing is clickable or hoverable
  - Only "Join Discord" and "Dismiss" banner visible but non-functional
  - Can tab through items but cannot activate with space/enter
  - Two DLSS_Updater.exe instances visible in Task Manager
  - Processes persist after closing the window
Dependencies:
  - Removed darkdetect>=0.8.0 (no longer needed - caused blocking startup issues).

Version 3.5.6:
Thread Safety & Memory Leak Fixes - Comprehensive fixes for Python 3.14 free-threaded mode:
  Critical Fixes (P0):
  - Fixed double-checked locking pattern in all singleton classes (DatabaseManager, ConfigManager, GameSearchService).
    In free-threaded Python, multiple threads could pass the outer check simultaneously.
  - Fixed thread-local database connections never being closed, causing memory leaks and file descriptor exhaustion.
  - Fixed asyncio.create_task() being called from ThreadPoolExecutor workers (would crash or create orphan coroutines).
  - Fixed SlidePanel overlay accumulation - panels now properly cleanup on all code paths including exceptions.
  - Fixed missing theme deregistration in SlidePanel causing memory leaks with each panel open/close cycle.
  - Fixed pool semaphore leak in database.py when aiosqlite.connect() raises exception.
  - Fixed ThreadPoolExecutor shutdown race using wait=False (now uses wait=True with cancel_futures=True).
  - Fixed fire-and-forget tasks in async_updater.py - evicted tasks now have proper exception handling.
  - All UI fire-and-forget tasks now registered with task registry for proper shutdown tracking.
  - Added SearchService shutdown() method and included in main_view shutdown sequence.
  - Fixed memory-mapped file handle leak in cache_manager.py using try-finally cleanup.
  - Fixed lock ordering deadlock risk in cache_manager.py by calling record_access() after releasing mmap_lock.
  High Priority Fixes (P1):
  - Fixed ConfigManager __init__ race condition by wrapping initialization in config lock.
  - Fixed TOCTOU in database pool state by making ensure_pool() atomic.
  - Added thread-safe lock for scanner.py global state (_dll_names_lower).
  - Fixed exception swallowing in scanner ThreadPoolExecutor - now differentiates expected vs unexpected errors.
  - Fixed os.scandir() resource leak by collecting subdirs first, then recursing AFTER closing scandir handle.
  - Fixed game card dictionaries not being cleared in games_view.py on_view_hidden().
  - Fixed cache dict modification during iteration in cache_manager.py by taking snapshot before iterating.
  - Fixed MmapHandle reference count bug - added guard against going negative.
  - All 11 scanner launcher tasks now registered with task registry for shutdown tracking.
  - Fixed task registry TOCTOU race by adding periodic cleanup of done tasks.
  - Fixed LATEST_DLL_PATHS unprotected reads - added get_dll_path() and get_all_dll_paths() thread-safe getters.
  - Fixed ConfigParser save() not being thread-safe.
  - Fixed LRU cache eviction bug using while loop instead of if (potentially evicting multiple entries).
  Medium Priority Fixes (P2):
  - Added thread-safe progress callback wrapper in scanner.py.
  - Registered cache manager cleanup task with task registry.
  - Added SearchBar cleanup() method for proper resource release.
  - Removed unused _search_cache_lock in search_service.py.
  New Utility Functions:
  - task_registry: Added reset_shutdown_state(), get_active_task_count(), get_task_names().
  - config: Added get_dll_path() and get_all_dll_paths() for thread-safe access.
  - search_service: Added shutdown() method for graceful cleanup.

Version 3.5.5:
Light/Dark Theme System - Complete theme support with automatic restart on toggle:

  - Collapsible expansion panels reveal individual DLLs with version details.
  - Per-group Update and Restore buttons for batch operations.
  - Brand-colored indicators match technology (NVIDIA green, AMD red, Intel blue).
  - Groups auto-expand when updates are available for quick visibility.
Bug Fixes:
  - Fixed race condition in game card UI lock that could block concurrent image loading.
  - Fixed memory leak in progress task tracking during bulk update operations.
  - Progress callback tasks now use bounded deque for O(1) cleanup instead of O(n²) list filtering.
  - Fixed tab bar container background color not matching page background in both themes.
  - Fixed launcher cards having tinted/colored backgrounds instead of transparent in light mode.
Dependencies:
  - Added darkdetect>=0.8.0 for cross-platform OS theme detection.
